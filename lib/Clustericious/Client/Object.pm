=head1 NAME

Clustericious::Client::Object - default object returned from client methods

=head1 VERSION

version 0.9940_04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $obj = Clustericious::Client::Object->new({some => 'stuff'});

 $obj->some;          # 'stuff'
 $obj->some('foo');   # Set to 'foo'

 #----------------------------------------------------------------------

 package Foo::Object;

 use base 'Clustericious::Client::Object';

 sub meth { ... };

 #----------------------------------------------------------------------

 package Foo::OtherObject;

 use base 'Clustericious::Client::Object';

 our %classes =
 (
     myobj => 'Foo::Object'
 );

 #----------------------------------------------------------------------

 my $obj = Foo::Client::OtherObj({ myobj => { my => 'foo' },
                                   some  => 'stuff' });

 $obj->myobj->meth();
 $obj->myobj->my;       # 'foo'
 $obj->some;            # 'stuff'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Clustericious::Client derived methods receive a possibly
nested/complex data structure with their results.  This Object helps
turn those data structures into simple (or possibly more complex)
objects.

By default, it just makes a method for each attribute in the returned
data structure.  It does this lazily through AUTOLOAD, so it won't
make them unless you are using them.  If used as a base class, you can
override new() to do more initialization (possibly using the client to
download more information), or add other methods to the object as
needed.

A %classes hash can also be included in a derived class specifying
classes to use for certain attributes.

Each Clustericious::Client::Object derived object can also call
$obj->_client to get the original client if it was stored with new()
(L<Clustericious::Client> does this).  This can be used by derived
object methods to further interact with the REST server.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

 my $obj = Clustericious::Client::Object->new({ some => 'stuff'});

 my $obj = Clustericious::Client::Object->new([ { some => 'stuff' } ]);

Makes a hash into an object (or an array of hashes into an array of
objects).

You can access or update elements of the hash using method calls:
 my $x = $obj->some;
 $obj->some('foo');

In the array case, you can do my $x = $obj->[0]->some;

If a derived class has a %classes package variable, new() will
automatically call the right new() for each specified attribute.  (See
synopsis and examples).

You can also include an optional 'client' parameter:

 my $obj = Clustericious::Client::Object->new({ ...}, $client);

that can be retrieved with $obj->_client().  This is useful for
derived objects methods which need to access the Clustericious server.

=head2 C<_client>

my $obj->_client->do_something();

Access the stashed client.  This is useful within derived class
methods that need to interact with the server.
